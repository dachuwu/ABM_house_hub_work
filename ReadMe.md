Introduction
------------

While Equation-based compartmental models were frequently used to
investigate the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases (e.g.
measles, rubella, smallpox, etc.), it is difficult to apply such method
to disease with complicated natural history or population heterogeneity.
This project applied an agent-based transsmission model with classic
susceptible-infectious-recovery process, and household-hub-workplace
mobility structurein order to model outbreaks under heterogeneous
settings. The designing process and report of our model follows the ODD
protocol for standard and transparent communication of agent-based
models (Grimm et al.,2006, Grimm et al.,2010)
